### PAK Tool 
Create and extract .pak archives from Mortal Kombat Armageddon PS2.

### Usage

To extract:

`paktool -e mkda.pak`

To create

`paktool -c \ps2dvd`

It is important to have the file folder up in your folder tree, eg:

` X:\PS2\MKA\ps2dvd\`

`  X:\PS2\MKA\tools\paktool.exe`

You can of course create it from current location, but game executable checks for one directory up path!
